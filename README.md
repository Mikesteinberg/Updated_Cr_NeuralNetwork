Updated Cr Neural Network


This was one of my first Neural Network Projects that I made during my free time in High School. 

This project includes a Neural Network, as well as a flask application to host an API that predicted the probability of outcomes of player vs player matches in Clash Royale. 

Prior to each match, players selected a deck of eight cards from eighty, and these cards would interact with each other In different ways. 

Unfortunately the API that was being used was completely overhauled and the data in this project in horribly outdated at this point.

There are several versions of certain files because I wasn't very acquainted with source control back when I developed this project. 

Based on what I can tell looking at this a few years after the fact, CR_Neural_Network_Preproccesing.py and Challenge_neural_network.py are the main networks, the .h5 files are trained models than can hopefully be loaded with enough effort (though they are outdated regardless due to updates), Api_Practice.py is the main data collection file, and there are a few files that use bottle which was used at the time to make a makeshift api to use on a server. 

Feel free to fork this repo if you dare.
